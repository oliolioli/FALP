S07 - Exercise 1:

These instantiation patterns do not enforce anything, they are to document the intended use:

i) The "+" argument: Argument must be given (even though it doesn't must be grounded): 

% foo(+N)
foo(X). - valid: Argument given, but not necesserily grounded.


ii) The "++" argument: Argument must be instantiated and must contain no variables (thus must be "grounded").

% foo(++N)
foo(42). - valid: Argument given and grounded.


iii) The "-" argument: Argument must be a variable - filled by the predicate.

% foo(-N)
foo(42). - not allowed, as it is no variable.
foo(X). - good, will be filled by the predicate.


iv) The "?" argument: Argument can be anything.

% foo(?N)
foo("The meaning of life"). - Perfectly fine.
